# Modern-C-Design
Examples for each chapter from "Modern C++ Design" by Andrei Alexandrescu

I picked up the book while I was rediscovering "The Binding of Isaac" and I decided to use policies from the first chapter to implement
the behavior of familiar. This led to me deciding to use the knowledge from the book to try and make a game using as much metaprogramming as possible.

Currently I'm going through the book and once I'm done I'll start work on the game.
